# Arrays

## Numerical Arrays

* Adding items by indexing
* Adding items by arraypush
* foreach operations

## Associative arrays

* Called "Maps" in Java.  Another name would be a "hash"
  *  $capital["Missouri"] = "Jefferson City";
  *  $capital["Iowa"] = "Des Mointes";
* Terms:
  * The part in [ ] is called the "key"
    * Each key may only once in the array 
  * The item held in the array csll is called the "value"
    * Values may be repeated.    
* Sorting
  * ksort() sorts on the key
  * sort() sorts on the value
* Adding items by indexing
* arraypush is not very useful for adding items to a associative array.
* foreach operations
