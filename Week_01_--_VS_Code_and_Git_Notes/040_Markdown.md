## About Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language.  It pops up in different places.  It is the formatting language used by Reddit.  It is also used for a lot of documentation projects.  Github is one place that uses it heavily.

There are different extensions to basic markdown.  Github has its own extensions.

## HTML

* Markdown is meant to be simplified HTML
* Markdown is converted to HTML
* You can do inline HTML and Latex (mainly for equations), but it will typically set off lint programs Some platforms may not support it.

## For VS Code

* Tons of extensions.  I use "Markdown All in One" by Yu Zhang.
* Either
  * Look for it in the market or
  * Ctrl P to open the command window with Ctrl-P and paste the following:

      ext install yzhang.markdown-all-in-one

  * Remember to reload
  * There should be a dual-pane icon in the upper right corner to turn on preview.
