# About Angular

Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/share/1000imAEQcdllXRQ==/

## Single Page Application

* Only one page loads
* As much work as possible happens in the Browser
* Very responsive
* Can frustrate ACT102 students.  When you view the source there often is very little HTML

## Framework

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework)

* The framework controls the flow of control.
* The developer controls the application by placing components in specific places.
* Funtionality can be controlled by overriding methods

### MVC Frameworks

Most modern frameworks uses some variation of "Model View Controller"

* Model -- The data and the buisiness logic
* View -- Just displays the data.  Has as little logic as possible.  Ideally there is no logic.  The saying is "Keep your view stupid."
* Controller -- This varies.  Lots of people have variations on the names and its function.  The dividing line between the controller and model is sometimes a bit fuzzy.

Angular is said to use MV* which is read as "Model-View-Whatever."

## Versions of Angular


### Angular 1, now called AngularJS

*	Uses JavaScript
*	About as easy to include as jQuery.  CDN is available.
*   It is technically a framework, but it isn't as "frameworky" as later versions of Angular.

### Angular 2 through 7

*	Uses Typescript
*   For practical purposes it requires npm from the Node.js package
    *   NPM is the "Node Package Manager"
        *   NPM can also be used to install things like jQuery.
        *   Most web developers will have it installed
        *   NPM creates the project structure
        *   When you save npm compiles the TypeScript to JavaScript and minifies it.
    *   NOde.js also runs a server, something like LiveServer does from VS Code.
*   6-month release cycle on versions.  7 isn't all that different from version 2.
    *   A couple of versions have been skipped.

## Typescript

## Bootstrap vs Bootstrap

* Bootstrap as advanced css
* Bootstrap as in Bootstraps
	* Pick yourself up by your Bootstraps
		* In IT, it generally means "a program that gets things started"
