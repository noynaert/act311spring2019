## About Code 

* A Microsoft product <span style="font-size:larger;">:scream:</span>
  * VS stands for "Visual Studio"
  * Open source
  * Runs on Windows, Linux, Mac
* Sometimes just called "code"
* Same author as Eclipse
* Can be anything from a code editor to an almost complete IDE like Intellij
* Can be a bit harder to use than Notepad++, but it has a lot more power.
* Integrates with Git
* Extensions to do almost anything
* Coded in TypeScript
  * TypeScript is an advanced form of JavaScript
  * TypeScript is also a Microsoft product <span style="font-size:larger;">:scream:</span>
  * It is configured like JavaScript.  Configuration options are set using JSON strings instead of clicking menus.

## Main Controls


<img src="codeIcons.png" style="float:left">
From Top to Bottom:

* Folder & File
* Find & Replace
* Git
* Debug
* Extensions

The controls are flyouts.  They take about half the screen when you press one of them.  To get rid of the image just click it again.

The Folders & Files tab tends to want to work in a view that emphasizes the folder over files


The blue  :two: means there are two files that are out of date in the git repository.  I find this to be the easiest git and GitHub interface available.


The extensions tab is very flexible.  It allows you to search for extensions, but it also can serve as a help screen for extensions that are already installed.

Try installing sftp/ftp sync by liximomo, Github Markdown Preview, and Markdown Preview Github Styling

** KEEP THE FLYOUT CLOSED UNLESS YOU NEED IT>
