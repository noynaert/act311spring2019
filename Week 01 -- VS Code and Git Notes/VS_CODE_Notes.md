  * VS stands for "Visual Studio"
  * Open source
  * Runs on Windows, Linux, Mac

* Can be a bit harder to use than Notepad++, but it has a lot more power.
* Integrates with Git
* Extensions to do almost anything
* Coded in TypeScript
  * TypeScript is an advanced form of JavaScript
  * TypeScript is also a Microsoft product <span style="font-size:larger;">:scream:</span>
