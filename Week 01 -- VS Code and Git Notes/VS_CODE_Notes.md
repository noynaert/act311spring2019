## About Code 

* A Microsoft product :scream:
  * VS stands for "Visual Studio"
  * Open source
  * Runs on Windows, Linux, Mac
* Sometimes just called "code"
* Same author as Eclipse
* Can be anything from a code editor to an almost complete IDE like Intellij
* Can be a bit harder to use than Notepad++, but it has a lot more power.
* Integrates with Git
* Extensions to do almost anything
* Coded in TypeScript
  * TypeScript is an advanced form of JavaScript
  * TypeScript is also a Microsoft product :scream: 
  * It is configured like JavaScript.  Configuration options are set using JSON strings instead of clicking menus.
