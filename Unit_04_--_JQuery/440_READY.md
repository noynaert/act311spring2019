# $( document ).ready() 

## Fixes the problem of when JavaScript loads

* Sometimes you need the elements to load so JavaScript can grab them (so put &lt;script>&gt; tag at the end
* Sometimes the JavaScript needs to be loaded first, (so put &lt;script&gt; tag at the top).
* The $(document).ready() method fixes this.  It is a function that happens after the document html loads, but before the images and media.

## The .ready() method takes an anonymous function. 

## Alternative syntax

* $ready()
* Just $() and put an anonymous function in it
* Several other options

### And example with a handler
